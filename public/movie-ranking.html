<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Super Troopers</h3>
<p>This is my favourite comedy ever, so many great moments.</p>
<h3>Batman beyond: return of the Joker</h3>
<p>One of my favorite animated action movies. I love the gritty cyberpunk nature they went with for Gotham in this movie and the show it is based off of.</p>
<h3>Top gun</h3>
<p>A classic for a very valid reason.</p>
